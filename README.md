# data2019nCoV R Package

This is a simple R package to store data about the 2019-2020 novel coronavirus outbreak. Currently, it contains the data extracted from the World Health Organization (WHO) situation reports (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports) stored in an object, `WHO_SR`.

The package can be installed via `devtools::install_github("eebrown/data2019nCoV")`.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome in the form of data updates, corrections, and the contribution of new datasets, provided they are publicly available, verifiable, and from a reputable source.

Raw data files (e.g. `.csv`) are in the `/raw-data` directory, along with a `.R` file that can be run to generate the data object for the package.
