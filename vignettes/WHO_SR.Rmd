# WHO Situation Report Data

This data was manually extracted from the WHO situation reports (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports) and stored in `raw-data/WHO_SR.csv', which is loaded as the data frame `WHO_SR` in this package.

## Plot example

```{r}
plot(WHO_SR$Date, WHO_SR$Global.confirmed, main = "Global 2019-CoV Confirmed Cases",
                                           xlab = "Date",
                                           ylab = "Confirmed Cases")
```

### Log examples

```{r}
plot(WHO_SR$Date, WHO_SR$China.deaths,     main = "2019-CoV Deaths (Logarithmic)",
                                           xlab = "Date",
                                           ylab = "Deaths",
                                           log = "y")

plot(WHO_SR$Date, WHO_SR$Global.confirmed, main = "Global 2019-CoV Confirmed Cases (Logarithmic)",
                                           xlab = "Date",
                                           ylab = "Confirmed Cases",
                                           log = "y")
